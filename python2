#Challenge: Your neighborhood grocery store is having a weird promotion called "Win free change". A random item is picked from your #grocery list and you pay 10 dollars. If the item is less than 10 dollars, you get the item and the balance from the items price. If #the item is more than 10 dollars, you get the item and the difference in the price as change. Write the code to randomly pick a #price from your price list and print out the amount the cashier
